          I currently work at SemanticBits, where I build software to improve how
          thousands of health care providers manage and analyze patient data. In
          2019, I graduated from University of California, Davis with a BS in
          Computer Science; while there, I led an on-campus organization, #include, built
          around fostering a community of undergraduate web developers.
